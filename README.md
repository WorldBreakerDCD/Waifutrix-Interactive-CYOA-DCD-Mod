Waifutrix Interactive CYOA DCD Mod

A repository for my (incredibly unbalanced) mod of Infaera's interactive conversion of Watchguy's original Waifutrix CYOA.

Changelog (DCD Mod v1.4.0)
- Changed the intro a little bit so that instead of the events of this CYOA taking place in our World, it takes place in a single 'Fictional World' of your choice, along with allowing you to insert a picture and description of your choice.
- Added an additional META Chain, META Chain (Free Choice), to the META Section, along with improving the wording on all choices.
- Added Witch's Blade, Mecha Musume, Symbiote, Kamui, and Completely Naked to Clothing Options.
- Locked Evolution and Fusion behind the Ultimate Waifutrix and new Bi-Bracelet options respectively.
- Added a whole boatload of new Advantages, including the A-Arms Raiser Equipment (along with the new Alien Slots point type), Magic Circuit Integration, Spell Archive Download, the Gadget Arms Raiser Cybernetic Enhancement, the Black Arms Genetic Enhancement, the Wonder Armor System, a certain Magic Ring, the Armlet of Transmutation, a Gamer System Interface, your very own Time-Stop Chill Zone, the Hypno Zapper, the Lewd Crest Engraver, and the Organic Drone Creator.
- Powered up World Portal by allowing you to travel to the Worlds of your Parallel Isotopes as well.
- Added even more Limits, in the form of Expanded 'Assets', Mana Tanks, Leaky Tanks, Extra Tanks, Fluid Futanarization, Monstrous Futanarization, Double Dragons, and Dark Empresses' Panties.
- Added an Ending, along with one last reward for anyone who wants to play more CYOAs in addition to this one, but didn't/couldn't take the META Chains.
